## 🪜 STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE (For Windows)

### 1️⃣ Create the Project Folder
Create a folder for your project:
```
your_folder_name/
```

### 2️⃣ Inside It, Create a `faces/` Folder
This is where captured face images will be stored.

### 3️⃣ Create a Virtual Environment
Open CMD and run:
```bash
python -m venv your_venv_name
```

### 4️⃣ Activate the Virtual Environment
```bash
your_venv_name\Scripts\activate
```

### 5️⃣ Install Required Packages
Either:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Or install packages manually:
```bash
pip install package_name
```

### 6️⃣ Move Project Files into Your Folder
Copy the following into your `your_folder_name/`:
- `faces/` folder  
- `accounts.csv`  
- `app.py`  
- `capture_face.py`  
- `requirements.txt`  

### 7️⃣ Configure Email Authentication
In `app.py`, **replace** the email and app password variables with your own.

### 8️⃣ Generate App Password for Email
1. Go to **[Google My Account](https://myaccount.google.com/)**  
2. Search for **"App Passwords"**  
3. Create an app name (e.g., `ATM App`)  
4. Copy the auto-generated password  
5. Paste it in `app.py` as your app password

### 9️⃣ Run the Face Recognition ATM
- To **capture and save your face**:
```bash
python capture_face.py
```

- To **run the GUI ATM interface**:
```bash
python app.py
```
